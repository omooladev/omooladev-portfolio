# Resume Versions

This folder contains different versions of the resume for easy management and updates.

## Structure

- `v1/` - First version of the resume
- `v2/` - Second version of the resume (add future versions here)

## Usage

1. To add a new resume version, create a new folder (e.g., `v3/`, `v4/`)
2. Place your resume PDF in the version folder
3. Update the resume link in the application to point to the desired version

## Current Active Version

The active resume link is set in: `app/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx`
